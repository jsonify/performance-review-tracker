@/data/accomplishments.csv I need to generate an Annual Review report for 2025. Please follow these instructions EXACTLY:

1. For EACH of these 7 criteria ONLY:
   - Communication
   - Flexibility
   - Initiative
   - Member Service
   - Personal Credibility
   - Quality and Quantity of Work
   - Teamwork

2. For EACH criterion, follow this EXACT structure:

   ## [Criterion Name]

   ### How I Met This Criterion
   - [Select ONLY 2-3 most relevant examples that demonstrate this criterion]
   - [For each example, include brief details and impact]
   - [DO NOT list all accomplishments - be selective]

   ### Areas for Improvement
   - [Identify 1-2 specific areas to improve for this criterion]
   - [Be specific and constructive]

   ### Improvement Plan
   - [Provide 3-5 concrete, actionable steps for improvement]
   - [Include measurable goals and timelines]

   ### Summary
   - [Write a concise paragraph summarizing performance in this area]
   - [Include key strengths and improvement opportunities]

3. IMPORTANT:
   - Select only the MOST RELEVANT examples for each criterion
   - If there's limited data for a criterion, make reasonable inferences
   - Provide improvement areas and plans even if they must be inferred
   - Be balanced and constructive
   - Follow the specified format precisely

4. End with an Overall Summary section that highlights key achievements and development areas.

DO NOT reorganize by accomplishment or impact level. Focus on analyzing by criteria.
