# Test Fixes Handoff - March 12, 2025

## Summary
Completed comprehensive fixes for test suite, including fixes for analyst prompt tests, final tests, and integration tests. Improved test reliability by fixing path handling, data processing, and validation issues across all test modules.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Enhance the markdown_to_docx conversion functionality to better handle markdown structure
- **MEDIUM**: Add more granular validation options for testing scenarios
- **LOW**: Add component-specific unit tests for individual modules

## Discoveries
- Path handling in integration tests needed consistent project root resolution
- TestAnalystPrompt class needed missing `_extract_primary_terms` method
- Empty data validation in data processor needed improvement
- DOCX conversion was causing test reliability issues, markdown format is more reliable for testing

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Integration tests failing due to incorrect working directory
  **Solution**: Added proper project root resolution and consistent cwd handling
  ```python
  project_root = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
  subprocess.run(command, check=True, cwd=project_root)
Problem: TestAnalystPrompt missing critical method
Solution: Implemented _extract_primary_terms with proper term weighting

def _extract_primary_terms(self, criterion_name: str, description_lines: List[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    primary_terms = {}
    # Extract terms from criterion name (higher weight)
    name_terms = criterion_name.lower().split()
    for term in name_terms:
        if len(term) > 3:
            primary_terms[term] = 0.4
    # Additional weighting logic for key phrases and action verbs
Problem: Data validation not catching empty datasets
Solution: Added proper validation with informative error messages

if df.empty:
    raise ValueError("No data found in input file")
