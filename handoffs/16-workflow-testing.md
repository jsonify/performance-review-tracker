# Workflow Testing Handoff - March 12, 2025

## Summary
Successfully tested the workflow automation system with real performance review data. Implemented end-to-end processing from raw data to final report generation. Added error logging and validation checks to ensure reliable execution of the automated workflow.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Document the workflow steps in user guide
- **MEDIUM**: Add error recovery procedures
- **LOW**: Create sample data set for testing

## Discoveries
- The workflow requires manual Roo Code analysis step between processing and report generation
- Logging to separate files helps with debugging each step
- The batch processing script successfully handles missing analysis files
- Performance review data structure works well with the automated workflow

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Missing Roo Code analysis file caused silent failures
  **Solution**: Added explicit check for analysis file existence
  ```bash
  if [ ! -f "$analysis_file" ]; then
      echo "Error: Roo Code analysis file not found. Skipping report generation."
      continue
  fi
  ```

- **Problem**: Debugging issues across multiple script executions
  **Solution**: Implemented separate log files for each script
  ```bash
  eval "$cmd" > process_data.log 2>&1
  eval "$cmd" > generate_report.log 2>&1
  eval "$cmd" > batch_process.log 2>&1
  ```

## Work in Progress
- User guide documentation: 0%
- Error recovery procedures: 0%
- Sample data creation: 0%

## Deviations
- Added logging to separate files instead of console output
- Implemented analysis file check in batch processing
- Created structured performance analysis template
