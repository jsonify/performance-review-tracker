# Performance Review System Fixes Analysis Handoff - 2025-03-12

## Summary
This handoff documents the analysis of the fixes implemented in the Performance Review Tracker System. We addressed the misalignment between AI output and code expectations by providing explicit formatting instructions in the system prompt. This ensured consistent report generation and template integration.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Ensure ongoing monitoring of AI output format consistency.
- **MEDIUM**: Document the debugging and testing strategies for future AI integration projects.
- **LOW**: Review and refine the debug logging levels in main.py for optimal visibility.

## Discoveries
- Explicit prompting is crucial for structured AI output.
- Format examples in prompts are more effective than abstract descriptions.
- Iterative testing and component-wise validation are essential for AI integration.

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: AI output was not structured as expected by the template, causing integration failures.
  **Solution**:  Updated the system prompt in `src/main.py` to include very explicit formatting instructions and required criteria sections.
Example of updated prompt section in src/main.py
prompt = (f"@{data_file} Please analyze this data to generate an Annual Review report. "
"Follow the exact format from the system prompt, with separate sections for each criterion: "
"1. Communication, 2. Flexibility, 3. Initiative, 4. Member Service, "
"5. Personal Credibility, 6. Quality and Quantity of Work, 7. Teamwork, "
"and an Overall Summary. For each criterion, include 'How I Met This Criterion', "
"'Areas for Improvement', 'Improvement Plan', and 'Summary' sections.")


## Work in Progress
- [Documentation Update]: 50% - Need to update developer documentation with lessons learned from this debugging process.
- [Testing Automation]: 20% - Explore options to automate testing of prompt effectiveness and output format.

## Deviations
- We deviated from the initial assumption that the AI would inherently understand the required output structure. We learned that explicit, directive prompting is necessary.
