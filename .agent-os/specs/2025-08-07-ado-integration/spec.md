# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Azure DevOps Integration Implementation
> Created: 2025-08-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Replace the current CSV-based data input workflow with direct Azure DevOps API integration to streamline performance review data collection. This implementation will activate the existing ado_user_story_client.py and integrate it with the main processing pipeline, eliminating manual CSV file maintenance and providing real-time access to User Story accomplishments.

## User Stories

### Performance Manager Data Collection

As a performance manager, I want to automatically pull my completed User Stories from Azure DevOps, so that I can generate performance reviews without manually maintaining CSV files and ensure all my accomplishments are captured accurately.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Configure Azure DevOps connection with organization, project, and Personal Access Token
2. Execute automated pull of completed User Stories assigned to current user
3. Map User Story fields to performance review data structure
4. Generate analysis using existing competency framework and templates

### Configuration Management

As a system user, I want centralized configuration management for all integrations, so that I can easily switch between data sources and maintain consistent settings across different environments.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Create or update config.json with Azure DevOps credentials and preferences
2. Validate configuration and test connections before processing
3. Support both direct API integration and fallback to CSV processing
4. Store user preferences for field mappings and filtering criteria

### LLM Integration Decision

As a system administrator, I want to evaluate and implement the optimal LLM integration approach, so that AI analysis is reliable, consistent, and maintainable for long-term usage.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Compare current Roo Code integration against direct LLM API approaches
2. Evaluate tools like Requesty for direct OpenAI/Anthropic API integration
3. Implement chosen approach with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing templates and report generation

## Spec Scope

1. **Azure DevOps Client Integration** - Complete implementation of ado_user_story_client.py with main.py integration
2. **Configuration System** - Centralized config.json management for credentials, field mappings, and preferences
3. **Data Transformation Pipeline** - Map Azure DevOps User Story fields to performance review data structure
4. **LLM Integration Evaluation** - Assess and implement optimal AI analysis approach (Roo Code vs direct API)
5. **Error Handling & Validation** - Comprehensive error handling for API failures, authentication issues, and data validation

## Out of Scope

- GUI interface development (reserved for Phase 2)
- Multi-user authentication and authorization systems
- Advanced analytics and trend analysis features
- Integration with other project management tools (Jira, GitHub)
- Custom competency framework configuration beyond existing 13-area model

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Azure DevOps Integration** - Users can successfully authenticate and pull User Story data directly from Azure DevOps APIs
2. **Seamless Data Processing** - Azure DevOps data flows through existing competency analysis and report generation pipeline
3. **Configuration Management** - Simple config.json setup enables quick switching between data sources and environments
4. **Reliable LLM Integration** - Chosen AI analysis approach works consistently with proper error handling and user feedback
5. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing CSV workflow remains functional as fallback option
