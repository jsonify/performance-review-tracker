# Workflow Automation Handoff - March 12, 2025

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive workflow automation for the Performance Review Tracking System. Created shell scripts for data processing, report generation, and batch operations, along with VS Code task integration. Added virtual environment handling and error management to ensure reliable execution.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Test the workflow automation with various input data scenarios
- **MEDIUM**: Add error logging to a dedicated log file
- **LOW**: Consider adding configuration files for default values

## Discoveries
- Virtual environment activation needs to be handled in shell scripts to ensure dependencies
- VS Code tasks can provide interactive input through custom prompts
- Batch processing requires careful progress tracking and error handling
- Shell scripts need consistent error reporting patterns

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: ModuleNotFoundError when running Python scripts
  **Solution**: Added virtual environment activation to shell scripts
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate || {
      echo "Error: Failed to activate virtual environment"
      exit 1
  }
  ```

- **Problem**: Complex command-line arguments were error-prone
  **Solution**: Implemented VS Code tasks with interactive prompts
  ```json
  {
    "type": "promptString",
    "description": "Path to input CSV/XLSX file",
    "default": "data/accomplishments.csv"
  }
  ```

- **Problem**: Batch processing needed progress visibility
  **Solution**: Added progress bar and percentage display
  ```bash
  printf "\rProcessing files: [%-50s] %d%%" $(printf "#%.0s" $(seq 1 $((percentage/2)))) $percentage
  ```

## Work in Progress
- Input validation improvements: 75%
- Error logging implementation: 50%
- Configuration file support: 0%

## Deviations
- Changed from manual command execution to VS Code tasks for better UX
- Added virtual environment handling in scripts instead of requiring manual activation
- Implemented progress tracking for batch operations instead of simple status messages
