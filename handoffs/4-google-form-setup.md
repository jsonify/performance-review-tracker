# Google Form Integration Handoff - March 11, 2025

## Summary
Completed the data collection interface setup by implementing a Google Form that automatically populates a Google Sheet. Modified the original approach from direct Sheet entry to Form-based entry for better data consistency and ease of use. Established manual CSV export process for data integration.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Implement data_processor.py to handle CSV file processing
- **MEDIUM**: Add date filtering for Annual Reviews
- **LOW**: Consider future automation of CSV export process

## Discoveries
- Google Form provides better data validation and consistency than direct Sheet entry
- Enterprise Google Workspace may have API restrictions for direct integration
- Manual CSV export process is reliable and compliant with enterprise policies

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Original plan required manual data entry in Google Sheet
  **Solution**: Implemented Google Form for structured data collection that automatically populates the Sheet
- **Problem**: Direct API integration might face enterprise restrictions
  **Solution**: Opted for manual CSV export process to ensure security compliance

## Work in Progress
- Data Processing Module: 0%
- CSV File Processing Implementation: Planning phase

## Deviations
- Changed from direct Google Sheet entry to Google Form-based data collection
- Simplified data export process to manual CSV export instead of API integration
