# Automation Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for automating the performance review process, from a CSV file of accomplishments to a final Markdown review, using the Roo Code Performance Review Analyst mode.

## Plan Summary

1.  Consolidate the `data_processor.py` and `report_generator.py` scripts into a single script (`src/main.py`).
2.  Modify the `src/main.py` script to automatically run Roo Code analysis using the processed data and the custom system prompt, and capture the output within the script.
3.  Implement a single command that takes the input CSV file and generates the final report (Markdown or DOCX) without manual intervention.
4.  Add comprehensive error handling and logging to the script.
5.  Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
6.  Add unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of the script.
7.  Develop shell scripts for common tasks, add VS Code tasks for frequent operations, and create batch processing capabilities.
8.  Update the documentation to reflect the changes and provide clear instructions on how to use the automated system.
