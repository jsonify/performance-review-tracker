**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I should first read the todo-list.md and performance-review-tracking-system-design-document.md files to analyze project status and determine next steps.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Let me read the design document to understand the technical requirements and implementation details.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

Based on the todo-list and design document analysis, here's the current project status and next steps:

## Current Phase
Phase 10: Workflow Integration and Optimization (In Progress - 33% Complete)

## Completed Tasks
- Created streamlined workflows with shell scripts
- Added VS Code tasks for frequent operations
- Created batch processing capabilities
- Enabled processing of multiple entries at once
- Implemented progress reporting for long operations

## Next Steps
1. Optimize performance:
   - Review and optimize data processing
   - Improve file handling efficiency
   - Enhance Roo Code interaction patterns

2. Complete batch processing:
   - Create summarization tools for large datasets

## Mode Recommendation
Switch to Code mode to implement performance optimizations and batch processing tools. The technical nature of these tasks requires direct code modifications to the data processing and file handling components.

To optimize performance, focus on:
- Improving data processor script efficiency
- Enhancing file I/O operations
- Implementing better caching mechanisms
- Adding batch processing summarization capabilities

[TASK RESUMPTION] This task was interrupted 1 minute ago. It may or may not be complete, so please reassess the task context. Be aware that the project state may have changed since then. The current working directory is now '/Users/jsonify/code/performance-review-tracker'. If the task has not been completed, retry the last step before interruption and proceed with completing the task.

Note: If you previously attempted a tool use that the user did not provide a result for, you should assume the tool use was not successful and assess whether you should retry. If the last tool was a browser_action, the browser has been closed and you must launch a new browser if needed.

New instructions for task continuation:

I used the new VS Code Task to generate the the report, but the @/output/review.docx and @/output/review.md files that are output with the @/scripts/generate-report.sh just give me look like a json formatted list of my accomplishments. I was expecting a review that uses the @/templates/annual_review_template.md . Am I missing something?
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Let me check the generate-report.sh script and report_generator.py to see why the template isn't being properly applied.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Let me check the report_generator.py implementation to see if it's properly using the template and Roo Code for analysis.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I see the issue. The data flow is incorrect. The current implementation just passes the JSON data directly to the report without:
1. Using the template from templates/annual_review_template.md
2. Actually analyzing the data through Roo Code to map accomplishments to criteria

Let me check if we have a data processor module that might need to be integrated.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I see the issue now. The workflow is broken because:

1. The data processor correctly formats the accomplishments into JSON
2. But the report generator is missing a crucial step - it's not using Roo Code to analyze the data and apply it to the template
3. According to the design doc, we should be using a sequence like:
   - Data processor prepares JSON data
   - Feed that data to Roo Code for analysis using the custom system prompt
   - Apply the analysis to the annual review template
   - Generate the final report

Let me fix this by updating the report generator to properly integrate with Roo Code.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Now I need to update the generate_final_report function to use the template and work with Roo Code's analysis.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Now that I've fixed the report_generator.py to properly handle templates and Roo Code analysis, the user needs to follow a different workflow. I should explain the new steps.
</thinking>

I've fixed the report generation system. The issue was that it wasn't properly using templates and Roo Code analysis. Here's the new workflow:

1. First, use the data processor to prepare your accomplishments:

This creates processed_annual.json in the data directory.

2. Use VS Code with Roo Code to analyze the data:
   - Open VS Code
   - Switch to Performance Analyst mode
   - Use the command: `@/data/processed_annual.json Please analyze this data for my annual review`
   - Roo Code will analyze the data using the annual review criteria and format it according to the template

3. Finally, generate the final report:

The report generator now:
- Uses the appropriate template from templates/
- Properly formats the analyzed data
- Supports both markdown and docx output formats
- Provides clear error messages if you need to use Roo Code first

The JSON data you're seeing is just the processed accomplishments - you need to let Roo Code analyze it first to map it to review criteria and generate the structured report.

Please use the VS Code interface to analyze the data with Roo Code first:

2. Switch to Performance Analyst mode
3. Use the command: @data/processed_annual.json Please analyze this data for my annual review and generate a structured report following the template format.

</feedback>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I need to check if a separate analyzed JSON file should be created after Roo Code analysis, rather than having the report generator try to do the analysis itself. Let me look at the workflow-automation-plan.md since it's open in the tabs.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I see the issue now. According to the workflow plan, we should be generating two files:
1. First, process-data.sh creates processed_annual.json
2. Then Roo Code analyzes this and its output should be saved as a separate file
3. Finally, generate-report.sh takes that analyzed file and applies the template

Let me check the generate-report.sh script to make sure it's configured correctly.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I need to modify the workflow to:
1. Let Roo Code analyze the data and save its analysis to a separate file in the data directory
2. Update generate-report.sh to expect this analyzed file instead of the raw processed data
3. Modify report_generator.py to simply apply the template to the analyzed content rather than trying to do the analysis itself
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Now I need to update the generate_final_report function to use load_analysis instead of analyze_with_roo_code.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Now that I've updated the Python code to handle the workflow properly, let me explain the revised process to the user.
</thinking>

I've fixed the report generation workflow. The process now has three clear steps:

1. Process the raw data into JSON (already done):

This creates data/processed_annual.json

2. Use Roo Code to analyze the data:
- Open VS Code
- Switch to Performance Analyst mode
- Run: `@/data/processed_annual.json Please analyze this data and generate a structured report`
- Save Roo Code's output to: data/analyzed_annual.md

3. Generate the final report using the template:

The error you saw was because step 2 (Roo Code analysis) hasn't been completed yet - the report generator is looking for data/analyzed_annual.md which should contain Roo Code's analysis. After you complete the Roo Code analysis step and save its output to data/analyzed_annual.md, the report generator will combine that analysis with the template to create your final report.
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
You're right. I should add the workflow steps to the todo list under Phase 10: Workflow Integration and Optimization, since that's where we're documenting the streamlined workflows.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Let me also check the workflow-automation-plan.md since it's open in the tabs and should document these workflow steps as well.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I should add a new section to the workflow-automation-plan.md to clearly document the three-step performance review workflow, including how Roo Code analysis fits in between data processing and report generation.
</thinking>
---

**Assistant:**

I've updated both the documentation files to clearly explain the three-step workflow:

1. docs/todo-list.md: Added the workflow steps under "Phase 10: Workflow Integration and Optimization"
2. docs/workflow-automation-plan.md: Added a new "Standard Workflows" section detailing the performance review process

The workflow is now properly documented and shows that you need to:
1. Process the raw data with process-data.sh
2. Use Roo Code to analyze the data and save to analyzed_annual.md
3. Generate the final report with generate-report.sh

This matches the updated report_generator.py implementation, which expects Roo Code's analysis to be saved as data/analyzed_annual.md before generating the final report. The error you saw earlier was because this intermediate file was missing.

Try running the workflow again, making sure to save Roo Code's analysis output to data/analyzed_annual.md before running the report generator.
