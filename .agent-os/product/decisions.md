## 2025-08-07: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Performance Review Tracker will serve as a comprehensive workplace productivity tool targeting professionals who struggle to articulate their work accomplishments effectively during formal evaluations. The system will maintain dual-path architecture (automated Python + AI-assisted analysis) with focus on competency-based assessment and career development support.

### Context

Universal workplace challenge where 70% of employees feel their contributions are underrecognized during review cycles. Existing tools either lack intelligence (basic templates) or are too generic (HR platforms without competency focus). Market opportunity exists for specialized tool that combines automation with professional presentation quality.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pure AI-Only Solution**
   - Pros: Maximum intelligence, simple architecture, modern approach
   - Cons: Higher costs, API dependencies, less predictable results

2. **Traditional HR Platform Extension**
   - Pros: Existing market channels, enterprise features ready
   - Cons: Generic approach, limited differentiation, complex integration

3. **Hybrid Automation + AI Approach** (Selected)
   - Pros: Cost efficiency, reliability, user choice, scalable intelligence
   - Cons: Complex architecture, multiple maintenance paths

### Rationale

Dual-path approach provides optimal user experience by combining reliable automated processing with optional AI enhancement. Allows cost-conscious users to benefit from automation while providing premium AI features for complex analysis. Architecture supports both individual and enterprise use cases.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Flexible pricing model opportunities (free automation + premium AI)
- Reliable core functionality independent of external AI services
- Ability to serve both technical and non-technical users effectively
- Strong differentiation through competency-focused intelligence

**Negative:**
- Increased architectural complexity with dual processing paths
- Higher development and maintenance overhead
- Potential user confusion about which analysis path to choose

## 2025-08-07: Competency Framework Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Technical Architect

### Decision

Adopt 13-competency framework with 5-point rating scale (Learning → Developing → Practicing → Mastering → Leading) as the standard assessment model, with keyword-based automatic mapping and impact-weighted scoring.

### Context

Need for standardized, comprehensive competency model that works across different professional roles and industries while providing objective assessment criteria. Framework must support both automated analysis and human interpretation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple 3-Point Scale**
   - Pros: Easy to understand, quick assessment
   - Cons: Insufficient granularity for career development

2. **Complex 10-Point Scale**
   - Pros: High granularity, precise measurements
   - Cons: Decision fatigue, difficult calibration

3. **Industry-Specific Frameworks**
   - Pros: Highly relevant, specialized terminology
   - Cons: Limited market scope, complex maintenance

### Rationale

13-competency model provides comprehensive coverage of professional skills while remaining manageable. 5-point scale offers sufficient granularity for development planning without overwhelming users. Keyword-based mapping enables automation while maintaining interpretability.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Comprehensive professional skill coverage across roles
- Clear development progression path for users
- Automation-friendly while maintaining human comprehension

**Negative:**
- May not perfectly fit all industry-specific requirements
- Requires ongoing keyword mapping maintenance

## 2025-08-07: AI Integration Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Under Review
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Currently using Roo Code (VS Code extension) for AI integration, with evaluation pending for migration to direct LLM API integration (potentially using Requesty or similar tools).

### Context

Need for reliable, scalable AI integration that provides sophisticated analysis without creating excessive dependencies. Current Roo Code integration works but requires VS Code environment and manual subprocess coordination.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Continue with Roo Code Integration**
   - Pros: Working solution, familiar workflow, VS Code ecosystem
   - Cons: VS Code dependency, manual coordination, limited scalability

2. **Direct LLM API Integration**
   - Pros: No IDE dependency, programmatic control, better scalability
   - Cons: API costs, service dependencies, more complex implementation

3. **Hybrid Approach with Optional AI**
   - Pros: Flexibility, cost control, graceful degradation
   - Cons: Complex architecture, multiple code paths

### Rationale

Decision pending based on Phase 1 development requirements and user feedback. Current Roo Code integration provides functional baseline while API integration offers better long-term scalability.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Maintains working AI integration during evaluation period
- Allows data-driven decision based on actual usage patterns

**Negative:**
- Architecture uncertainty affects Phase 2 planning
- Potential technical debt if migration required

## 2025-08-07: Data Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Superseded
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Focus on CSV-only data input with robust validation and processing capabilities. Remove Azure DevOps integration to simplify architecture and reduce complexity.

### Context

Based on user feedback and project requirements, the complexity of maintaining Azure DevOps integration outweighs the benefits. Users prefer the simplicity and reliability of CSV-based workflows, and the additional maintenance overhead of API integrations is not justified for the current use case.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Maintain Azure DevOps Integration**
   - Pros: Automated data collection, real-time accuracy, enterprise features
   - Cons: Complex implementation, authentication overhead, limited user adoption

2. **CSV-Only Approach** (Selected)
   - Pros: Simple, no external dependencies, universal compatibility, reliable
   - Cons: Manual data entry required

### Rationale

CSV format provides universal compatibility and simplicity. Users can export data from any system (Azure DevOps, Jira, GitHub, etc.) to CSV format, maintaining flexibility while eliminating integration complexity.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simplified architecture and reduced maintenance overhead
- Universal compatibility with any data source
- Improved reliability and fewer points of failure
- Easier deployment and configuration

**Negative:**
- Manual data export step required from source systems
- No real-time data synchronization
