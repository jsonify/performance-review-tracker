# System Prompt Enhancements Handoff - 3/13/2025

## Summary of Recent Changes

### Problem Addressed
We've addressed the issue of having to use extremely verbose, explicit instructions every time you run the Performance Review Analyst. The previous approach required long, detailed prompts that:
- Were not user-friendly
- Needed to be copied and pasted
- Required manual updates for different review types
- Made the workflow cumbersome

We've separated and enhanced the system prompts to create a more elegant solution:

#### 1. Created Two Specialized System Prompt Files
- **`.roo/system-prompt-annual-analyst`**
  - Contains only the 7 Annual Review criteria
  - Includes explicit formatting requirements
  - Has detailed output guidelines with exact section structure
  - Incorporates error handling and quality check instructions

- **`.roo/system-prompt-competency-analyst`**
  - Contains all 13 Competency criteria
  - Uses the same explicit instruction format for consistency
- Made the workflow cumbersome

### Solution Implemented
We've separated and enhanced the system prompts to create a more elegant solution:

#### 1. Created Two Specialized System Prompt Files
- **`.roo/system-prompt-annual-analyst`**
  - Contains only the 7 Annual Review criteria
  - Includes explicit formatting requirements
  - Has detailed output guidelines with exact section structure
  - Incorporates error handling and quality check instructions

- **`.roo/system-prompt-competency-analyst`**
  - Contains all 13 Competency criteria
  - Uses the same explicit instruction format for consistency
  - Has clearly delineated sections for easier future modifications
  - Includes the same structured output requirements

#### 2. Simplified User Experience
- Previous approach: 40+ lines of explicit instructions needed in every prompt
- New approach: Simple one-line prompts like:
  ```
  'data/accomplishments.csv' (see below for file content) '.roo/system-prompt-annual-analyst' (see below for file content) Please generate my annual review report for 2025.
  ```

#### 3. Maintained Custom Role Structure
- Kept the existing `performance-analyst` custom role definition
- No changes needed to `.roomodes` configuration
- No code changes required in Python scripts
- Leveraged Roo Code's file referencing capabilities

#### 4. Improved Documentation
- Updated README with simplified instructions
- Added explanation of system prompt files
- Included simple example prompts for both review types
- Added instructions for customizing competency criteria

#### 5. Enhanced Maintainability
- Clear separation between annual review and competency assessment criteria
- Well-structured system prompts with obvious section boundaries
- Easier to update when job roles change (just modify the competency criteria section)

### Implementation Benefits
1. **Simplicity**: Drastically simplified user prompts while maintaining structure
2. **Consistency**: Ensured consistent report formatting across all analyses
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separated the two different review types
4. **Flexibility**: Made it easier to customize for different job roles
5. **Robustness**: Added quality checks to ensure proper output formatting
6. **Usability**: Reduced potential user errors with simpler prompts
7. **Zero Code Changes**: Implemented the solution without modifying any Python code

This solution represents a significant improvement in the usability and maintainability of the Performance Review Tracking System while following the KISS and DRY principles.
