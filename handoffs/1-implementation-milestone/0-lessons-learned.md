# Implementation Milestone 1 - Lessons Learned

## Technical Insights

### Testing Practices
1. **Early Test Implementation**
   - Writing tests alongside code improved design
   - Test fixtures helped maintain clean test data
   - Pytest's parametrize feature reduced test code duplication

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Comprehensive tests caught edge cases early
   - Mock objects helped isolate components for testing
   - Test-driven development improved code reliability

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**
   - Separating data processing from report generation was beneficial
   - Utility functions shared across modules reduced code duplication
   - Clear interfaces between modules simplified testing

2. **File Handling**
   - Using timestamps in filenames prevented conflicts
   - Standardized file naming conventions improved organization
   - Central output directory simplified file management

### Libraries and Tools
1. **Python-docx**
   - Good markdown conversion capabilities
   - Some limitations with complex formatting
   - Documentation could be improved

2. **Development Environment**
   - VS Code + Python extension provided excellent debugging
   - Linting and formatting tools improved code quality
   - Git integration streamlined version control

## Process Improvements

### What Worked Well
1. Breaking implementation into focused modules
2. Writing tests alongside feature development
3. Regular documentation updates
4. Clear separation of concerns
5. Standardized file naming conventions

### What Could Be Improved
1. More detailed API documentation upfront
2. Earlier consideration of edge cases
3. More granular Git commits
4. Better progress tracking in todo list
5. More thorough error handling documentation

### Recommendations for Future Phases
1. Document API design before implementation
2. Create more detailed test plans
3. Implement logging earlier in development
4. Add more inline code documentation
5. Consider creating development guidelines document

## Documentation Insights
