# Self-Rating System Completion Handoff - 2025-03-13

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive self-rating system for annual reviews with a 1-3 scale (Poor, Good, Excellent). Added validation for ratings and justifications, updated templates and system prompts, and modified data processing to support the new functionality.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Test the self-rating system with sample data to verify validation works correctly
- **MEDIUM**: Update user documentation to include self-rating guidelines
- **LOW**: Consider adding rating visualization in future iterations

## Discoveries
- Integrated self-ratings directly into the annual review criteria flow
- Added validation ensures ratings are numeric and within 1-3 range
- Rating justification is now required for each rating

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Needed to validate numeric ratings while handling potential non-numeric input
  **Solution**: Implemented pd.to_numeric with 'coerce' option to handle invalid inputs
  ```python
  data['Self Rating'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Self Rating'], errors='coerce')
  ```

- **Problem**: Required clear rating criteria in the template
  **Solution**: Added explicit rating scale definition at the top of the template
  ```markdown
  ## Rating Scale Definition
  - 1 (Poor): Minimal alignment with criteria expectations
  - 2 (Good): Meets most criteria expectations
  - 3 (Excellent): Consistently exceeds criteria expectations
  ```

## Work in Progress
