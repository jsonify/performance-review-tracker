# Competency Assessment Improvements Handoff - 3/13/2025

## Summary
Enhanced the competency assessment system to support command-line arguments, system prompt parsing, and consistent output paths. Modified the assessment generator to properly process rating definitions from the system prompt and output reports to a standardized location.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)

- **HIGH**: Verify that competency rating definitions are being correctly extracted from the system prompt
- **MEDIUM**: Add unit tests for the new command-line argument handling
- **LOW**: Add documentation for the updated script usage

## Discoveries
- System prompt contains structured competency definitions that can be parsed programmatically
- Rating scale definitions need special handling to maintain newlines in output
- Command-line arguments provide more flexibility than hardcoded paths

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: System prompt parsing was not handling competency names correctly
  **Solution**: Modified parsing logic to handle "N. CompetencyName" format by splitting on dot and taking second part

- **Problem**: Rating definitions were not being correctly matched to competencies
  **Solution**: Updated the rating key format to use consistent separators and implemented proper string matching

## Work in Progress
- Competency definition parsing: 90% complete
- Command-line argument handling: 100% complete
- Report generation paths: 100% complete

## Deviations
- Changed from using CSV-based competency definitions to parsing from system prompt for better maintainability
- Modified output path to use output/competency_assessment.md instead of data/analyzed_competency.md for consistency
