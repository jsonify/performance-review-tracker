# Validation Implementation Handoff - 2025-03-11

## Summary
This handoff documents the work done on improving the validation process for performance review reports. This included creating a new `src/validation.py` module with functions for validating report structure, content completeness, and criteria coverage. Tests were also created in `tests/test_validation.py` and `tests/test_integration.py` to ensure the validation logic works correctly.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Fix the failing tests.
- **MEDIUM**: Consider adding more flexibility to the `validate_report_structure` function.

## Discoveries
- The initial integration tests were not adequately validating criteria coverage for competency assessments.

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: The diff format was incorrect when trying to update `tests/test_integration.py`.
  **Solution**: Wrote the complete file content instead of using a diff.

## Work in Progress
- Fixing the failing tests: 0%

## Deviations
- None
