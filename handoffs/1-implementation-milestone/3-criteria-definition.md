# Criteria Definition Handoff - March 11, 2025

## Summary
Completed Phase 3 by creating JSON definition files for both annual review and competency assessment criteria, along with their corresponding report templates. All files were structured according to the design document specifications and include detailed expectations for each criterion.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Begin Google Sheets integration (Phase 4) to enable data collection
- **MEDIUM**: Test the created templates with sample data to verify formatting
- **LOW**: Consider adding validation scripts to verify JSON criteria files

## Discoveries
- Breaking down the criteria into structured JSON format helps maintain consistency
- Template structure allows for easy mapping between criteria and final reports
- Separating expectations into distinct bullet points improves clarity

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Needed to ensure consistent structure between criteria files and templates
  **Solution**: Used the design document sections 3.4.1 and 3.5 as reference to maintain alignment

## Work in Progress
- Criteria Definition Phase: 100% Complete
  - Created annual_review_criteria.json
  - Created competency_assessment_criteria.json
  - Created annual_review_template.md
  - Created competency_assessment_template.md

## Deviations
- None. All files were created according to design specifications
