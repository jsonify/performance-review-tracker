# Testing Improvements

## Current Status
We are improving the test suite for the accomplishment analysis system, focusing on better matching logic for performance review entries. The main improvements include:

1. Enhanced term normalization using known variations dictionary
2. Improved quality boost calculations with weighted indicators
3. Better keyword extraction with composite term handling
4. More accurate confidence scoring
5. Better handling of technical and documentation-related terms

## Key Components Updated
1. TestAnalystPrompt class with methods:
   - `_normalize_term`: Handles word variations and common suffixes
   - `_calculate_quality_boost`: Context-aware quality scoring
   - `_extract_keywords`: Enhanced keyword extraction
   - `_calculate_match_confidence`: Improved confidence calculation

## Progress
- âœ… Implemented term normalization with known variations
- âœ… Added quality indicators with weighted scoring
- âœ… Improved composite term handling
- âœ… Enhanced confidence calculation
- ðŸš§ Working on fixing the `_extract_primary_terms` integration

## Next Steps
1. Implement the missing `_extract_primary_terms` method
2. Add comprehensive test cases for all term variations
3. Validate confidence scoring against a broader set of entries
4. Add logging for better debugging of term matching

## Issues and Challenges
1. Current issue: `_extract_primary_terms` method is missing from the test class
2. Need to ensure consistent term normalization across all methods
3. Need to validate quality boost calculations with real-world data

## Dependencies
- pytest for test execution
- Sample accomplishment data in JSON format
- System prompt containing criteria definitions

## Notes for Next Session
1. Start by implementing the `_extract_primary_terms` method
2. Focus on improving term normalization consistency
3. Consider adding more test cases for edge cases
4. Add detailed logging for debugging term matches
5. Consider adding performance metrics for matching operations
