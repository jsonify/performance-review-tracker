# VS Code Setup Handoff - March 11, 2025

## Summary
Completed Phase 2 setup of VS Code and Roo Code integration. Configured Python development environment, set up custom Performance Review Analyst mode, and created system prompts for performance review analysis.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: ~~Test Performance Review Analyst mode functionality with sample data~~ (COMPLETED)
- **MEDIUM**: ~~Create sample performance review data for testing~~ (COMPLETED)
- **LOW**: Consider adding additional VS Code tasks for common operations

## Discoveries
- PowerShell requires different command syntax for directory listing (`dir` instead of `ls -la`)
- Python script for conversation extraction requires explicit input file parameter
- Performance Review Analyst mode successfully processes and analyzes work accomplishments

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Python extraction script failed with no parameters
  **Solution**: Added specific chat history file path to command
  ```bash
  python handoffs/0-system/scripts/1-extract_conversation.py handoffs/0-system/chat-history/cline_task_mar-11-2025_6-31-33-am.md
  ```
- **Problem**: Needed sample data for testing Performance Review Analyst mode
  **Solution**: Created data/sample_accomplishments.json with test entries and verified analysis capabilities
  ```json
  [{"Date": "2024-10-15", "Title": "Performance Review System Design", ...}]
  ```

## Work in Progress
- VS Code Configuration: 100%
  - Installed and configured Python tools (pylint, black)
  - Set up VS Code settings.json with Python configurations
- Roo Code Setup: 100%
  - Created system prompt for Analyst mode
  - Added Performance Review Analyst custom mode
- Basic Functionality Testing: 100%
  - ✓ Created sample test data
  - ✓ Tested Analyst mode successfully
  - ✓ Verified report generation capabilities

## Deviations
- Added more comprehensive tool permissions for Performance Analyst mode (read, edit, command, mcp)
- Included file pattern matching for all review-related file types (.md, .json, .docx)
